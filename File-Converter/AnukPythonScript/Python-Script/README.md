make sure to remove 

subprocess.run(['pip', 'install', 'python-docx'])# remove this is python-docx module installed 
subprocess.run(['pip', 'install', 'reportlab'])# remove this is reportlab module installed 

from conversion.py if you have python-docx and reportlab installed in your environment. Having it and running wont cause a harm to the output.
