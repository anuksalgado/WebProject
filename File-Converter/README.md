# Track-record and IMPORTANT (will be updated in the coming days if any change)

- To NOTE: Patterson Leon's Document Converter shall not be used for complex word structure files, as it uses Mammoth JS and puppeteer to do the conversion. To get proper detailed conversion of word to pdf file, we"ll have to use a corporate API such as pspd or convertapi, etc which we have to pay money for.

The converted document would not preserve exact indentation but would include all the elements of the word file with images embedded.

# TODO's and extra mentions
 
- Proper Styling for the downloadDoc.ejs file needs to be done, and if the conversion was unsuccessfull for that styling needs to be done as well. Also overall styling can be improved in the coming days.

- The animation used in the homepage was taken from a youtube video I reffered for an individual project of mine, which i cant find the video to mention as reference.
