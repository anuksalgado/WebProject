# General description

## Product perspective

This website functions without any ties to any organisation and would interact with actors which would be defined below.

## Product functions

The website would allow an ease of maintaining academic responsibilities for students. The website aims to, in the future, to collaborate with universities in order to provide a detailed breakdown of marks and scores which students can use to measure their progress and effort needed to achieve required grades. The website will be able to run on machines specified in the hardware requirements. Students can then interact with the website in order to save and retrieve work. Interact with tabs and tools to cater to a personalised style. Use calendar where user can set dates for future work and reminders on it. Document converter would also be present. Notebooks can be categorised. Word count tool and mark calculation and visualisation will be present. The website will also implement a email authentication system and will interact with other applications like a calendar app for importing of dates.

## User characteristics

There are two main actors for this website

- Student - the students are the main focus of this website and will be interacting with the front end the most
- Maintainers (developers) - the developers will work on the backend and ensure that the frontend also works as intended in harmony with the backend

## Operative environment

The website will run on popular web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and more. 

The website will initially be set to run on web browsers on laptops or computers then be adapted run run on web browsers on mobile phones which run IOS and Android

## Design and  implementation constraints

The major constraint is the limitation of websites and how well web browsers can handle our code base. A standalone application for desktop and mobile will be developed later. 

The mark visualisation system is limited by universities and their permission to give access to students grade database in order for a visualisation to be provided to the students. 

## User documentation

- Student - the website will initially guide the user on how to use the basic features of the website and there will be an FAQ and user support section for further enquiries. User readme files will also be available on a GitHub repository.
- Maintainers (developers) - the developers will use this document for guidelines on what the app was intended to do and a GitHub repository of all the documentation will be available to them

## Assumptions and dependencies

It is assumed that the basic features will be implemented and are mentioned below

1. Word counter implementation and making the processing happen in backend. 
2. Another use case to be added
3. Very basic HTML and JS. Maybe some CSS designs but not needed.
